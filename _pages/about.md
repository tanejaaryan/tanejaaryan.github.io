I am a MSCS (Research track) student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I am working with [Prof. Deepak Vasisht](https://deepakv.web.illinois.edu/). I also received the prestigious [J.N TATA Scholarship for Higher Education](https://jntataendowment.org) for my education. This summer, I am interning with the Open Connect Transport R&D Team at Netflix.

Previously, I worked at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) for ~2 years where I got the opportunity to work with many amazing people who are also my mentors - [Venkat Padmanabhan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/padmanab/), [Debopam Bhattacherjee](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/debopamb/), and [Rohan Gandhi](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rohangandhi/). I have also interned at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com) where I worked in the Engineering Development Group.


My research interests broadly span Networking, Systems for LLMs and Machine Learning. More specifically, I have worked on projects that involve Transport and Congestion Control Optimization, Efficient LLM inference, and edge computing for video streaming.  

Before joining Microsoft, I graduated from IIIT-Delhi with a B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering. I worked with [Prof. Arani Bhattacharya](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~arani/), [Prof. Sanjit Kaul](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjitkkaul/), [Prof. Koteswar Rao](https://sites.google.com/site/koteswarraojerripothula/) and [Prof. Mukulika Maity](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~mukulika/) for my undergraduate research & thesis.
