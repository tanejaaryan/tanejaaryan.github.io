abstract = {Network measurement has long focused on the bits and bytes --- low-level network metrics such as latency and throughput, which have the advantage of being objective and directly characterizing the performance of the network. We argue that users provide a rich and largely untapped source of implicit as well as explicit signals that could complement and expand the coverage of traditional methods. Implicit feedback leverages user actions to indirectly infer the network performance and the resulting quality of user experience. Explicit feedback leverages user input, typically provided offline, to expand the reach of network measurement, especially for newer ones.We analyze two scenarios: capturing implicit feedback through user actions from a large-scale conferencing service -- MS Teams and gathering explicit feedback via social media posts pertaining to the SpaceX Starlink Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network undergoing deployment. We believe our techniques complement the traditional measurement methods and open up a broad set of research directions, ranging from rethinking measurement tools to designing user-centric networked systems and applications.},

abstract = {As the world rapidly becomes technologically advanced and socially connected, mental well-being is considered an important factor for people. In our work, We discuss some practical solutions to improve mental health and well-being keeping in mind the problems that people face. We first conducted a survey with around 60 people from various parts of India to understand the issues and challenges faced when trying to access mental well-being resources. Further, we investigated a few existing solutions available to bridge identified gaps. Finally, we analyze the user needs and propose an integrated solution, Peacify. This prototype tries to provide better access to mental health professionals and self-help groups by removing situations where people might face social pressure. It provides access to mental health and well-being content for users to explore. Peacify also aims to bring down various barriers with multi-lingual support, advanced privacy/anonymity checks, as well as user-specific and context-aware content. We discuss and reflect upon the user-centered design process we used to create the prototype and further build upon the feedback received from the participants during iteration and evaluations.},
